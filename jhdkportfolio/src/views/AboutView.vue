        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am an avid learner, working into the world of tech. I have always
        enjoyed building and repairing computers, coding seems like a good
        logical step to use as a creative outlet. I also highly enjoy problem
        solving so coding is a fun, yet frustrating way to get more of that into
        my day. For fun I love to cook, read, play instruments, listen to music,
        listen to birds, go for long drives, swim in the ocean or watch the
        skies at night.
