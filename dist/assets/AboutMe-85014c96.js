I have always enjoyed building and repairing computers, however that was not the career path I would have chosen for fulfilling work. I wanted something with a creative outlet, rewarding, fun, challenging and something that I could do anywhere. <br> After joining the cohort through U.C Berkeley, I started to feel like this was the right path to get me to where I am going, albeit an arduous path. <br> I have taken on several personal projects and I am working with some team-mates that I stuck with after the cohort was over, to work and develop some projects together. I am constantly on the lookout for open-source projects that I can contribute to, and doing drills and challenges to get my skills up. </p><div class="container py-4 text-left"><ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><h3>Random hobbies and interests / Fun</h3><li>Beach trips and tidepooling</li><li>Body Surfing</li><li>Working Out/ Hiking, have lost 40lbs since last April!</li><li>Record Collecting/ Vintage Audio Gear</li><li>Playing Guitar</li><li>Succulents</li><li>Fungus &amp; Mycology</li><li>Reading, currently on a Sci-Fi kick</li><li>Spending hours on Google Maps looking at the world, finding interesting places to go or research </li></ul></div><h4><p>Copyright 2023 @ Jesse Hudak | Made with Vue.js/ Vite/ TailwindCSS &amp; VSCode</p></h4></div>',1),r=[l];function c(h,d){return t(),o("div",s,r)}const g=e(n,[["render",c]]);export{g as default};
